            <p>
              As part of the innovation program, the initial mandate was to create different designs for the execution of a knee replacement surgery using the patented implantable IMU into the medullary canals of the femur and tibia.
              During the brainstorming phase of this project, a non-invasive method of locating the long axis of the tibia was identified and patented.
              Immediately upon presenting the ideas to leadership, they requested that a proof of concept be built in time for the board of directors visit in 3 months.
              The patented method required a redesign of the typical hardware used in knee replacement surgery in order to incorporate a distance measuring system.
              Creating this prototype became a passion project for the team, where many after-work crafting sessions took place in order to finish the prototype in time for the board of directors.

                  The original team that came up with the patented design, did not have the skills to create the software components that were required.
                  So the initial challenge was to recruit some individiuals to build out software side for the proof of concept.

                <p className="pt-2 text-base">
                  To recruit the people with the skills required to build out the envisionned prototype, we had to negotiate with project leads to
                  ensure that all team members could dedicate at least 8 hours a week on this side project. Unfortunately, we had poor luck and around half of the projects that
                  were under development at that time hit a emergent state due to various reasons and the software part of the prototype kept having to change hands.

                  During the project's prototyping phase, the original product manager had to stop overseeing this project's progression. I therefore stepped up to the plate
                  and took over their responsibilities temporarily until they were freed up to resume their role on this project. In the interim, I provided progress reports to the leadership team,
                  advocated for the ressources the project needed, and dealt with all blocking points that came up.

            <p>
              This was a passion project for the entire team.
              It was the first instance in my corporate career where I had the chance to work alongside individuals who were passionate enough to work into the wee hours of the morning.
              We spent countless extra hours over our lunch breaks, and after-work on this project to be able to deliver it on time.
              It was such a joy working in such a collaborative and productive environemnt that once the project was over, returning to normal everyday work seemed so dull.
              I've since learnt that I thrive in a fast-paced environement and tend to perform best when under pressure as I treat is as an invigorating challenge.
