            <h4>Qualitative Customer Interviews</h4>
            <p>
              User research at the start of the project was invaluable and was perfomed with 8 surgeons from various backgrounds. Some work primarily on trauma cases,
              others specialize in pediatric cases, while others mainly treat the elderly. Each surgeon had different needs and all of their workflows differed. Around this time,
              we also consulted with our sales representatives in the field who travel all over the United States and Europe to support cases.
              All of this information was compiled so that we were able to lay out each surgical workflow that our system had to be able to support which helped us to define the following 3 main surgeon profiles:

              <p>
                The orignal release was launched in 2008, so the existing UI application's design system is dated. An initiative was launched at the very
                start to align the new version of the ROSA application with the style of the orthopeadic products in Zimmer Biomet's existing robotic portfolio.
                This was the first time that a coordinated effort was made to document the existing design system of the Knee, Hip and Shoulder applications so as
                to be able to leverage them for the more modern Brain application.

                Having learnt from previous projects, the team moved to using Figma and took full advantage of Figma's protyping feature to validate UI
                changes with the surgeons prior to implementation. This helped the team to drastically decrease the development time of a software feature
                due to our prototypes being better able to communicate the UI's desired behavior. Using Figma prototypes allowed us to
                observe surgeons using the proposed designs without interference, leading to the quick identification of each design's weaknesses.

                Using Figma prototypes greatly reduced the amount of information that tends to get lost in translation between product/design
                and the software team that is implementing the feature.

            <h4>Periodic Releases & Exploratory Testing</h4>
            <p>
              Every quarter, a new release was presented to the design surgeons so that iterative feedback could be received.
              The system design team also put in place the habit of systematically performing non-regression and exploratory tests after each sprint to help to identify both design and technical debt.

            <h4>Robotic Features</h4>
            <p>
              This project was the first opportunity that I had to influence robotic features.
              Close collaboration with the team in France that manufactures and maintains the robot is constantly required and poses a challenge for me from a technical perspective.
              I am continuously in the process of expanding my understanding of how our robotic controller works along with its intrinsic limits and potential risks.

                  This project had many unique needs that could be best answered by having local access to all imaging modalities and to a wet lab for R&D investigations.
                  At the begining of the project, no such relationships existed between Zimmer Biomet and the local medical community.
                  I therefore led the initiative to put in place key relationships that I maintain to this day which has helped our project not only gain answers to fundamental questions
                  surrounding the new features we wish to implement, but also helped our team reduce development costs we would have incurred otherwise.

            <p>
              This project awarded me the opportunity to own the vision, definition and implementation of complex
              software and robotic features. Exposing me to the basics of robotics and the technical difficulties related to the practical implementation of
              these sub-systems. Working hand in hand with the software team allowed me to quickly identify flaws in my inital Figma design proposals that from an
              implementation point of view were eitehr not ideal, or simply were not feasible given the timeline. This allows for open discussion on
              what was considered minimally viable for the feature we wanted to ultimately implement in the final product given the timeline.
            </p>
            <p>
              All in all, the entire team has achieved a great amount in the redesign of the existing product.
              At our peak, my scrum team of 5 software developers and 3 system designers were able to achieve a huge milestone by implementing an entire patient registration workflow within 16 weeks.
              I cannot wait to see how surgeons will react to the release of the new updated version of this beloved device.
